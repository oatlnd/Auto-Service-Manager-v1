## DATA STRUCTURE

### Job Card Object
```javascript
{
  id: string,              // "JC001", "JC002", etc.
  customerName: string,
  phone: string,
  bikeModel: string,       // Honda CB350, Shine, Unicorn, etc.
  registration: string,    // "NP-1234"
  serviceType: string,     // "Regular Service", "Repair", "Premium Service"
  status: string,          // "Pending", "In Progress", "Quality Check", "Completed"
  assignedTo: string,      // "Technician 1", "Senior Technician", etc.
  bay: string,            // "Bay 1" to "Bay 5"
  estimatedTime: string,  // "45 mins", "2 hours"
  cost: number,           // Amount in LKR
  createdAt: string,      // ISO timestamp
  odometer: number,
  repairDetails: string,  // Optional notes
  advancePayment: number, // Auto-calculated based on service type
  remainingPayment: number, // Auto-calculated
  paymentStatus: string   // "Paid in Full" or "Advance Paid"
}
```

### Daily Statistics Object
```javascript
{
  today: number,       // Total jobs today
  completed: number,   // Completed count
  inProgress: number,  // In progress count
  pending: number,     // Pending count
  revenue: number      // Total revenue from completed jobs
}
```

## STORAGE IMPLEMENTATION

**Using window.storage API:**
- Store job cards: `await window.storage.set('job_cards_list', JSON.stringify(jobCards))`
- Retrieve: `const result = await window.storage.get('job_cards_list')`
- Parse: `const jobs = JSON.parse(result.value)`
- Handle errors with try-catch
- Initialize with sample data if storage is empty

**Sample Initial Data:**
Include 3 sample job cards:
1. Regular service in progress (Bay 1)
2. Repair in quality check (Bay 4)
3. Completed regular service (Bay 2)

## BUSINESS LOGIC

### Payment Policy
- **Regular Service or Premium Service:**
  * Calculate: advancePayment = cost (100%)
  * Calculate: remainingPayment = 0
  * Set: paymentStatus = "Paid in Full"
- **Repair:**
  * Calculate: advancePayment = cost * 0.5
  * Calculate: remainingPayment = cost * 0.5
  * Set: paymentStatus = "Advance Paid"

### Statistics Calculation
- Auto-update daily stats whenever job cards change
- Revenue = sum of cost for all completed jobs
- Status counts = filter jobs by status

### Bay Assignment
- Track which bay has which job
- Show as occupied if status is not "Completed"
- Calculate utilization percentage

## USER INTERACTIONS

### Modal Behavior
- Click outside or X button to close
- Form validation on submit
- Clear form after successful creation
- Show loading states during save

### Status Updates
- Click status button in view modal
- Update immediately in database
- Refresh all views automatically
- Visual feedback (button highlight)

### Search & Filter
- Real-time updates as user types
- Combine search and filter (AND logic)
- Case-insensitive search
- No results message if empty

## RESPONSIVE DESIGN
- Mobile: Single column layouts, stacked cards
- Tablet: 2-column grids
- Desktop: 3-4 column grids
- Collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Horizontal scroll on tables for mobile

## ERROR HANDLING
- Try-catch blocks for all storage operations
- Console.error for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to empty state if data load fails
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## PERFORMANCE
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Efficient filtering with proper array methods
- Minimal re-renders
- Smooth animations (transition-all duration-200)

## ACCESSIBILITY
